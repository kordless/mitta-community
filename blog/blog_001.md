## Building Mitta
I've been working on Mitta for over 2 years now. Mitta was originally designed to save and search webpages, but when OpenAI released their first GPT-based language model, I knew things were going to change rapidly with the Web, and search in particular. I kenw that building document collections was likely the best approach to grounding language models, and so I began working on adding a generative language model framework into Mitta to help with organizing and discussing the documents that were saved to the system.

Eventually, Mitta will provide community driven curration of various types of documents, embeddings for those documents through vectoriztion, search of documents and document fragments, and vector approximation and similarity functions. We will also be providing training pipelines and inference methods for building bots from documents, among other things.

### Signing Up
Things here are in flux, but I resumed working on the site in August to get to a point I can do a release. I've opened signups to allow anyone to sign up for a free account. Just go to the main page and click on log in at the top right to get a login token.

### Use
Right now the AI functions are being rewritten, so you may find using the functions available via `!help` are your best bet for using it right now. You can save things, upload things and search for things. That should get you started.

### A Note on VC Money
I have been considering raising money for building Mitta faster, but honestly it feels a bit too early at this point for that and I'm not sure this business model (or my ideas what to do with it) really resonate with the "typical" VC market. I'm also a little tired of justifying my ideas to others, so what I'm going to do for now is just work on it when I can and see what happens.

I will post back a more detailed update once I get the blog templates finished. You can't have a site without a blog... :)
