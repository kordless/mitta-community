## Building Mitta
I've been working on Mitta for over 2 years now. Mitta was originally designed to save and search webpages, but when OpenAI released their first GPT-based language model, I knew things were going to change rapidly with the Web, and search in particular. I realized that building document collections was likely the best approach to integrating with language models, and so I began working on adding a generative language model framework into Mitta to help with organizing and discussing the documents that were saved to the system.

### Signing Up
I wanted the process for signing up for Mitta to be super easy and secure. Mitta uses tokenized logins, which are similar to the way most sites work when they reset your password. When you signup for Mitta, we'll email you a token you can use to login to the site. Logins on Mitta last for 20 days per device.
