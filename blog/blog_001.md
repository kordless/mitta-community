## Building Mitta
I've been working on Mitta for over 2 years now. Mitta was originally designed to save and search webpages, but when OpenAI released their first GPT-based language model, I knew things were going to change rapidly with the Web, and search in particular. I kenw that building document collections was likely the best approach to grounding language models, and so I began working on adding a generative language model framework into Mitta to help with organizing and discussing the documents that were saved to the system.

### Signing Up
Things here are in flux, but I resumed working on the site in August to get to a point I can do a release. I've opened signups to allow anyone to sign up for a free account. Just go to the main page and click on log in at the top right to get a login token.

### Use
Right now the AI functions are being rewritten, so you may find using the functions available via `!help` are your best bet for using it right now. You can save things, upload things and search for things. That should get you started.

I will post back a more detailed update once I get the blog templates finished.
